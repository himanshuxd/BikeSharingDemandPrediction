## Project Overview

BloomBikes, a U.S.-based bike-sharing company, is addressing revenue decline due to COVID-19 by planning a post-lockdown business strategy. Collaborating with a data analytics firm, they aim to maximize profits by analyzing factors influencing shared bike demand in the American market. The project's main goal is to develop a predictive model that identifies key variables impacting demand, helping management tailor their strategy and understand market trends for potential new markets.The project utilizes the `day.csv`` dataset encompassing data on various aspects like date, season, year, month, holiday status, day of the week, working day indicator, weather situation, temperature, apparent temperature, humidity, wind speed, as well as counts for casual and registered bike users.
